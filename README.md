# TZMBot
Discord bot made for The Zeitgeist Movement Discord server

The folder "TZMBot" contained within this directory contains two .py files.
"bot.py" is the one that must be run in order to launch the bot.
If "bot.py" and "role_reactions.py" are not in the same directory then everything in "role_reactions.py" will not work and possibly a lot more functionality could be lost.

all commands aside from the info command currently in the bot are set to only be runnable by me, of course you can change the string containing my ID and it will work with that user instead.
